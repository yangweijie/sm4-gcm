*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Testing

*   All code changes should be accompanied by tests
*   Tests should be well-structured and easy to understand
*   Run the full test suite before submitting a pull request
*   Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request

## Documentation

*   All public methods should have docblocks
*   Complex algorithms should be explained in comments
*   Update README.md if you change functionality
*   Add examples for new features
