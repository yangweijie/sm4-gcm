# Story 1.1: Implement OpenSSL-based SM4-GCM for comparison testing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement an OpenSSL-based SM4-GCM algorithm for comparison testing,
**so that** I can verify the correctness of the existing SM4-GCM implementation against a trusted reference implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An OpenSSL adapter for SM4-GCM is implemented and integrated with the existing codebase
2. Comparison tests are created that validate the existing implementation against the OpenSSL implementation
3. The comparison tests can be executed using the specified PHP version at 'D:\Program Files\PhpWebStudy-Data\app\php84.exe'
4. Test results clearly show any discrepancies between the two implementations
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the new testing approach

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create or enhance the OpenSSL adapter to fully support SM4-GCM operations
  - [x] Ensure the adapter properly handles encryption and decryption with AAD
  - [x] Add proper error handling and validation
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2)
  - [x] Design comparison test framework that can run the same test vectors against both implementations
  - [x] Implement test cases that cover various scenarios (different key sizes, IV lengths, AAD usage, etc.)
  - [x] Create test data generators for consistent testing
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up test execution environment using the specified PHP version
  - [x] Create scripts to run comparison tests with the OpenSSL-based PHP
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 4)
  - [x] Execute comparison tests and document results
  - [x] Identify and document any discrepancies between implementations
- [x] Task 5 (AC: 5)
  - [x] Update README.md with instructions on how to run comparison tests
  - [x] Document any findings or limitations of the comparison testing approach

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this story beyond the existing SM4GCMParameters and related classes.

[Source: IFLOW.md#辅助类]

### API Specifications
The story will work with the existing SM4GCM API:
- SM4GCM::encrypt(string $plaintext, string $aad = ''): string
- SM4GCM::decrypt(string $ciphertext, string $aad = ''): string

[Source: IFLOW.md#方法]

### Component Specifications
The implementation will involve:
1. OpenSSLAdapter class that implements SM4-GCM using OpenSSL
2. Comparison test framework that can run tests against both implementations
3. Test scripts that can execute with the specified PHP version

### File Locations
Based on the existing project structure:
- Adapter implementations: src/Adapter/
- Test files: tests/
- Test scripts: tests/scripts/ (new directory)

[Source: IFLOW.md#目录结构]

### Testing Requirements
- Create comparison tests that validate both implementations produce identical results
- Test with various inputs including edge cases
- Document any discrepancies found
- Ensure tests can be run with the specified PHP version

[Source: IFLOW.md#测试]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the PHP version at 'D:\Program Files\PhpWebStudy-Data\app\php84.exe' for OpenSSL-based tests
- The OpenSSL implementation should be compatible with the existing API
- All existing functionality should remain unchanged

### Debug Log References
- Task 1: Enhanced OpenSSLAdapter to fully support SM4-GCM operations with proper error handling and validation
- Task 2: Created comparison test framework with test cases covering various scenarios and test data generators
- Task 3: Set up test execution environment with scripts to run comparison tests using the specified PHP version
