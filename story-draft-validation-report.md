## Specific Issues

None identified. The story provides comprehensive guidance for implementation.

## Developer Perspective

As a developer, I could implement this story as written. The story clearly defines:

1. What functionality to implement (OpenSSL-based SM4-GCM for comparison testing)
2. The specific acceptance criteria that must be met
3. Technical details including data models, API specifications, and component requirements
4. Task breakdown with clear references to source documentation
5. Testing requirements and scenarios

The only minor questions that might arise are:
- What specific test vectors should be used for validation?
- Are there any performance requirements that need to be met?
- Should the built-in implementation be prioritized or is OpenSSL sufficient?

However, these are minor clarifications that wouldn't block implementation.

## Final Assessment

READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
